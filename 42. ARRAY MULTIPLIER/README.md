## Introduction to Array Multiplier
The Array Multiplier is a fundamental component in digital design, primarily utilized for efficiently multiplying two binary numbers. It leverages an array of logic elements to conduct the multiplication operation in parallel, rendering it suitable for high-speed applications.

## Operation
The Array Multiplier executes by dissecting the multiplication process into smaller, manageable steps, distributing them across the array of logic elements. Each element undertakes a partial product calculation, and their outputs are amalgamated to derive the final result.

A conventional depiction of an Array Multiplier comprises rows and columns of logic elements. Each row computes partial products, and the ultimate result is acquired by aggregating these partial products.

## Working Example
Let's elucidate the operation of the Array Multiplier with a comprehensive example:

- **Input Data**: A = 4 (binary: 0100), B = 3 (binary: 0011)

The Array Multiplier would conduct the multiplication of A and B utilizing its array of logic elements. Each element computes a partial product, and the final result is obtained by summing these partial products.

## Verilog Implementation
For the implementation details of the Array Multiplier, please refer to the provided Verilog code.

## Truth Table
The truth table furnishes a comprehensive overview of the behavior of the Array Multiplier for diverse input combinations.

| A (Input) | B (Input) | P (Output) |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 0000      | 0000      | 00000000   |
| 0000      | 0001      | 00000000   |
| ...       | ...       | ...        |
| 1111      | 1110      | 11101110   |
| 1111      | 1111      | 11111111   |

## Applications
The Array Multiplier finds applications across various domains, including digital signal processing, cryptography, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and graphics processing units (GPUs).

## Theoretical/Logical Representation
The Array Multiplier's theoretical and logical representation can be depicted as follows:

|------|------|------| A3 | A2 | A1 | A0 | 
|------|------|------|----|----|----|----|
|------|------| *x*  | B3 | B2 | B1 | B0 |
