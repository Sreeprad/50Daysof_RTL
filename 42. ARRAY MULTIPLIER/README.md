## Introduction to Array Multiplier
The Array Multiplier is a key component in digital design, specifically used for multiplying two binary numbers efficiently. It employs an array of logic elements to perform the multiplication operation in parallel, making it suitable for high-speed applications.

## Operation
The Array Multiplier operates by breaking down the multiplication process into smaller, manageable steps, distributing them across the array of logic elements. Each element handles a partial product calculation, and their outputs are combined to obtain the final result.

A typical diagram of an Array Multiplier consists of rows and columns of logic elements. Each row computes partial products, and the final result is obtained by summing these partial products.

## Working Example
Let's illustrate the operation of the Array Multiplier with a detailed example:

- **Input Data**: A = 4 (binary: 0100), B = 3 (binary: 0011)

The Array Multiplier would perform the multiplication of A and B using its array of logic elements. Each element computes a partial product, and the final result is obtained by summing these partial products.

## Verilog Implementation
I have provided the Verilog implementation for the Array Multiplier. Please refer to the provided Verilog code for the implementation details.

## Truth Table
The truth table provides a comprehensive overview of the behavior of the Array Multiplier for various input combinations.

| A (Input) | B (Input) | P (Output) |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 0000      | 0000      | 00000000   |
| 0000      | 0001      | 00000000   |
| ...       | ...       | ...        |
| 1111      | 1110      | 11101110   |
| 1111      | 1111      | 11111111   |

## Applications
The Array Multiplier finds applications in various fields, including digital signal processing, cryptography, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and graphics processing units (GPUs).

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Array Multiplier is a vital component in digital design for efficient multiplication operations. Its parallel processing capability enables high-speed multiplication, making it suitable for various applications in digital systems.
