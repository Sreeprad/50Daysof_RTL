## Introduction to Johnson Counter
A Johnson Counter, also known as a Twisted Ring Counter, is a digital counter circuit that cycles through a sequence of states in a circular fashion. It is constructed using flip-flops interconnected in a specific manner to generate a sequence known as the Johnson sequence.

## Operation
The Johnson Counter operates by shifting the state of its flip-flops in either direction (up or down) through feedback connections. This shifting action results in the generation of a sequence that includes every possible state of the counter exactly once.

## Truth Table
The truth table for a 4-bit Johnson Counter illustrates its behavior for various clock inputs:

| Clock | Q3 | Q2 | Q1 | Q0 | Count |
|-------|----|----|----|----|-------|
| 0     | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1     |
| 1     | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 2     |
| 2     | 0  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 3     |
| 3     | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 4     |
| 4     | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 5     |
| 5     | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 6     |
| 6     | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 7     |
| 7     | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 8     |

## Applications
Johnson Counters find applications in digital systems requiring sequence generation, such as frequency dividers, pattern generators, and control circuits.

## Theoretical/Logical Representation
The Johnson Counter's theoretical and logical representation can be depicted using a circuit diagram, illustrating its flip-flops, clock input, and feedback connections.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Johnson Counter provides a systematic way to generate a cyclic sequence of states in digital systems. Understanding its operation, truth table, and applications is essential for designing and implementing digital systems requiring sequence generation functionality.
