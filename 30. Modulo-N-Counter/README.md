## Introduction to Modulo-N Counter
A Modulo-N Counter is a digital counter circuit that counts in a modulo-N fashion, where N represents the total number of states before the counter resets. It is commonly used to generate a sequence of binary numbers from 0 to N-1 and then reset to 0, cycling through the states.

## Operation
The Modulo-N Counter operates by incrementing its count by 1 for every clock pulse applied to it. When the count reaches the value of N-1, the counter resets to 0 and starts counting again. This cyclic counting behavior ensures that the counter generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to N-1 repeatedly.

## Truth Table
The truth table for a 4-bit Modulo-16 Counter illustrates its behavior for various clock inputs:

| Clock | Q3 | Q2 | Q1 | Q0 | Count |
|-------|----|----|----|----|-------|
| 0     | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0     |
| 1     | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1     |
| 2     | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 2     |
| 3     | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 3     |
| 4     | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 4     |
| 5     | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 5     |
| 6     | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 6     |
| 7     | 0  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 7     |
| 8     | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 8     |
| 9     | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 9     |
| 10    | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 10    |
| 11    | 1  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 11    |
| 12    | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 12    |
| 13    | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 13    |
| 14    | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 14    |
| 15    | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 15    |
| 16    | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0     |

## Applications
Modulo-N Counters find applications in digital systems requiring cyclic counting with a specific maximum value, such as in timers, frequency dividers, and control circuits.

## Theoretical/Logical Representation
The Modulo-N Counter's theoretical and logical representation can be depicted using a circuit diagram, illustrating its flip-flops and connections for counting and resetting.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Modulo-N Counter provides a straightforward way to generate a cyclic sequence of numbers with a specific maximum value in digital systems. Understanding its operation, truth table, and applications is essential for designing and implementing digital systems requiring cyclic counting functionality.
