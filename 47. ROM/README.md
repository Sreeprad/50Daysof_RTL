## Introduction to ROM
ROM is a type of memory that stores data permanently. Unlike RAM, ROM retains its contents even when the power is turned off. It is commonly used to store firmware, microcode, and other critical system data.

## Structure of ROM
ROM is organized into rows and columns, forming a matrix of memory cells. Each cell stores a bit of data, and the size of the ROM is determined by the number of rows and columns. In a 15 x 15 ROM, there are 15 rows and 15 columns, resulting in 225 memory cells.

## Applications
ROM is used in various applications, including:
- Storing boot code in microcontrollers
- Holding font data in display systems
- Storing calibration data in electronic devices
- Storing configuration data in FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) devices

## Designing a ROM [15 x 15]
To design a ROM with dimensions 15 x 15, you need to specify the data to be stored in each memory cell. This can be done using initialization vectors or through Verilog instantiation with pre-defined data values.

## Conclusion
ROM with dimensions 15 x 15 offers a compact yet significant storage solution for various applications in digital systems. Understanding its structure, applications, and design principles is essential for efficient utilization in electronic design projects.
