## Introduction to Booth's Multiplier
Booth's Multiplier is a multiplication algorithm devised by Andrew Donald Booth in 1951. It optimizes the multiplication of two binary numbers by reducing the number of partial products required to be added together compared to the standard multiplication algorithm. This reduction is achieved by identifying sequences of consecutive bits in the multiplier and using them to generate partial products.

## Operation
Booth's Multiplier operates by examining consecutive pairs of bits in the multiplier, treating them as a two-bit signed integer. Based on the value of this two-bit integer, Booth's algorithm determines whether to add or subtract the multiplicand (based on the value of the two-bit integer) or simply shift the partial product. By efficiently handling these operations, Booth's Multiplier reduces the overall number of partial products generated and added, thereby improving efficiency.

## Working Example
Let's illustrate the operation of Booth's Multiplier with a detailed example:

- **Input Data**: Multiplier = 5 (binary: 0101), Multiplicand = -3 (binary: 1101)

Booth's Multiplier would perform the multiplication of the multiplier and multiplicand, leveraging its algorithm to optimize the process. It identifies sequences of consecutive bits in the multiplier to generate partial products and efficiently adds or subtracts them to derive the final result.
