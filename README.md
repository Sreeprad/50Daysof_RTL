# 50 Days Digital Design Challenge

Welcome to the 50 Days Digital Design Challenge repository! üöÄ

## Overview

This repository documents my journey through a daily challenge of Digital design. Each day, I explore a different aspect of digital circuitry, from basic components like half adders to more complex elements like multiplexers and demultiplexers. Through this challenge, I aim to sharpen my skills, deepen my understanding, and share my progress with the community.

## Repository Structure

- `Verilog`: Contains Verilog code for each analog layout design challenge.
- `Schematics`: Includes schematic files illustrating the circuit diagrams for each design.
- `Progress`: Documents daily updates, insights, and reflections on the challenges faced and lessons learned.
- `Resources`: Provides additional resources, references, and helpful materials related to analog layout design.
- `Simulation`: Holds simulation files and results for verifying the functionality of each design.
