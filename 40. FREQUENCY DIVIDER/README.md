## Introduction to Frequency Dividers
Frequency dividers are essential components in digital circuits used to reduce the frequency of an input signal by a fixed division ratio. They find applications in various areas, including clock generation, frequency synthesis, and signal processing.

## Even Frequency Divider
An even frequency divider divides the input frequency by an even number. It generates an output pulse for every two input pulses.

## Odd Frequency Divider
An odd frequency divider divides the input frequency by an odd number. It generates an output pulse for every two input pulses, plus one additional output pulse after an odd number of input pulses.

## Verilog Implementation
I have included the Verilog code for implementing both even and odd frequency dividers within a single module. Please refer to the provided Verilog files for detailed implementation.

## Truth Tables
The truth tables below illustrate the behavior of the frequency dividers for various input signal combinations:

### Even Frequency Divider
| CLK | OUT |
|-----|-----|
| 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   |
| 0   | 0   |
| ... | ... |

### Odd Frequency Divider
| CLK | OUT |
|-----|-----|
| 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   |
| ... | ... |

These truth tables showcase the behavior of the even and odd frequency dividers in dividing the input frequency.
