## Introduction to Binary Up Counter
A Binary Up Counter is a digital circuit that counts upwards in binary sequence. It consists of flip-flops arranged in such a way that each flip-flop represents a bit of the counter. The counter increments its count by 1 for every clock pulse applied to it, resulting in a binary count sequence from 0 to its maximum count value.

## Operation
The Binary Up Counter operates by toggling its flip-flop outputs in a binary sequence. Each flip-flop represents a bit position, and the counter counts upwards by 1 for every clock pulse. When the count reaches its maximum value, it wraps around to 0 and continues counting.

## Truth Table
The truth table for a 4-bit Binary Up Counter illustrates its behavior for various clock inputs:

| Clock | Q3 | Q2 | Q1 | Q0 | Count |
|-------|----|----|----|----|-------|
| 0     | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0     |
| 1     | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1     |
| 2     | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 2     |
| 3     | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 3     |
| 4     | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 4     |
| 5     | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 5     |
| 6     | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 6     |
| 7     | 0  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 7     |
| 8     | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 8     |
| 9     | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 9     |
| 10    | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 10    |
| ...   | ...| ...| ...| ...| ...   |
| 15    | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 15    |
