## Introduction to Universal Shift Register
The Universal Shift Register is a versatile component in digital design, capable of shifting data either left or right, as well as performing parallel loading. It offers flexibility in shifting operations, making it a valuable tool in various applications.

## Operation 
The Universal Shift Register operates by shifting the data input either left or right based on the control signals provided. It can also load data in parallel when the appropriate control signal is activated. The shift direction and parallel loading are controlled by the shift left (SL) and shift right (SR) signals, respectively.

## Working Example
Let's illustrate the operation of the Universal Shift Register with a detailed example:

- **Input Data**: 8 bits (D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0)
- **Control Signals**: Shift Left (SL), Shift Right (SR)
- **Operation**: Shifting data left or right based on control signals.

In this example, the Universal Shift Register will shift the input data either left or right based on the control signals provided, demonstrating its versatile shifting capabilities.

## Verilog Implementation
Implementing the Universal Shift Register in Verilog involves defining the module with appropriate input and output ports and implementing the logic to shift the data left or right based on the control signals. Additionally, logic for parallel loading may be included as per requirements.

## Truth Table
The truth table below provides a comprehensive overview of the behavior of the Universal Shift Register for various input combinations:

| SL | SR | Operation          |
|----|----|--------------------|
| 0  | 0  | No shift           |
| 0  | 1  | Shift right (SR)   |
| 1  | 0  | Shift left (SL)    |
| 1  | 1  | Parallel load (PL) |

This truth table illustrates how the Universal Shift Register behaves based on the control signals provided, indicating the operation to be performed.
